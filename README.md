# ADVENT OF CODE - 2019

These are my attempts at Advent of Code 2019 (<https://adventofcode.com/2019>).

I don't promise that these solutions are any of the following:

- correct
- sane
- performant
- worth your time reading

I also don't promise to complete the entire Advent of Code (life gets in the way sometimes).

Do what you want with this code.

## Setup

I'm using a VSCode Dev Container. Go Google what that is...they're awesome, and it makes dev setup stupidly easy.
